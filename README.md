# Recommender System for E-Commerce Platforms

## Project Summary

The goal of this Recommender System (RS) is to generate meaningful recommendations for users about products or items that might interest them. Recommender systems are increasingly vital due to the widespread use of social media and the demand for personalized experiences. Popular applications of recommender systems include large streaming services like Spotify or Netflix and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon.

The core functionality of this system revolves around predicting the utility of items for users based on their preferences or behavior. This project focuses on creating a recommendation engine that leverages user ratings and reviews to provide product suggestions on e-commerce platforms.

During the development phase, Python and its libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) were extensively used to analyze data from online shopping platforms and generate product recommendations for users based on their ratings and reviews.

## Project Scope

This Recommender System enhances the user experience on e-commerce platforms by simplifying the product browsing process. Instead of manually searching through numerous offers, users receive personalized product suggestions that are most relevant to them, based on historical data. For businesses, this personalization aims to boost customer satisfaction, increase sales, and improve overall engagement with the platform.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to implement a **popularity-based recommendation system** that can suggest the most popular products to new users, helping solve the "cold start" problem. Over time, the system learns from user behavior to provide more personalized recommendations using various filtering techniques.

## Key Features

- **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Suggests the most popular items for new users with no prior purchase history.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Analyzes the userâ€™s past buying behavior and demographic data to provide tailored suggestions.
- **Sentiment-Based Filtering**: Recommends products based on positive feedback (ratings, reviews) from other customers.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: 
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - VS Code
  - MS Excel
